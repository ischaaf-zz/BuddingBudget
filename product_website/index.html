          <h2>What is Budding Budget?</h2>
          <p>Budding Budget is the budgeting software for people who have given up on ever using budgeting software. Even though having a structured budget is almost universally accepted to be a good idea, many people - particularly college students - have hardly even tried to keep one. We believe this is because current offerings like You Need a Budget or Mint.com overwhelm many users with too much information and too many options.
          <br>
          <br>
          With Budding Budget, instead of having to micromanage your budget and separate your money into dozens of artificial categories, you manage your assets and charges only when your life situation changes, and are reminded every day of the application’s recommendation for what you should spend. It’s the budgeting software that manages you, instead of forcing you to manage it.
          </p>

          <h2>User View</h2>
          <p>Budding Budget can be used entirely offline or with online support. If you choose to create an account with us, all your budgeting data will be backed up in the cloud and accessible from multiple devices. If you don't, your experience with the app itself will be almost identical. You'll only miss out on our cloud features. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The initial setup walks you through a serial of screens to get assets, savings, recurring charges, recurring income, and additional options set. This walkthrough can be done with assistance from an optional tutorial. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Budding Budget is designed to be easy to navigate, therefore the user experience is organized around the main screen, which displays how much money you should spend today. There is a pull out menu with buttons that connect to all the screens in the top left corner of every screen for convenient access. Besides the main screen, all other screens are to update any monetary settings that were set when the app was first opened. There are also quick links to specific screens in the app via notifications, which when clicked on will take you to the relevant screen. For example, the daily notification to update spending will take you to the Track Spending screen. The Track Spending screen only has a text box to input how much you spent. If the user over or underspends, a popup is shown with radio button options to choose how to handle the situation. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Most of the other screens have box selection menus, sliders, and/or text boxes to edit settings. The user can also easily add additional categories to savings, recurring income, and recurring charges with the click of a button.
          <br>
          <br>
          Beta Release: Not all features yet available. Tutorial and account login not yet implemented. Neither is notifications. However all the pages in the app are up. The main page, assets, savings, recurring income, recurring charges, track spending, and options pages are available for use (barring beta test bugs- see our Github issue tracker for list of bugs).

          <h2>Install Guide</h2>
          <p>You can install and run Budding Budget by downloading the .apk file linked below and installing it on the Android device of your choice! If you would like, you can also build the application from the source, also linked below. In the future, we're hoping to have a presence on the Google Play store, as well as prebuilt versions of the app for different mobile operating systems, but since we're in early beta, this is the best way to install the app.

          <h2>User Guide</h2>
          <p>For Budding Budget to work correctly, it needs to know a variety of information regarding your accounts and desired budgeting goals. You are prompted to input this information during the setup phase of the guided tour, however after that point you are still able update this information on the appropriate screens.  
          <br>
          <br>
          Once the information has been entered, the app will take care of the rest. The main feature of Budding Budget is the daily notifications and daily budgeting, thus to properly use the app you simply need to interact with the app on a daily basis. This daily interaction involves inputting the required information such as: how much did you spend that day and if you want to alter the amount of money in your savings. Furthermore, if you require the information to be shared amongst multiple devices, all you need to do is set up an account with us and use the same login on each device with the Budding Budget app installed. The app’s functionality can be extended to web based budgeting help (such as analytics and statistics) in the future, but there is currently no definitive plan for how this feature will be implemented.

          <h2>Bug Report Instructions</h2>
          <p>
            The most helpful way to submit a bug report is to add it to our repository on Github as an issue. If it’s visible there, that means that members of the development team, as well as anyone wanting to contribute to the software can access it. If you don’t want to go through this trouble, please email your bug report to us, and we can add it to the issue tracker on the repository ourselves.

            Since our project is relatively small, we don’t require a very strict format for bug reports - please just try to give us enough information so we can understand where our software went wrong, and so we can reproduce what happened to you. Otherwise, we’ll have no way of fixing it.
